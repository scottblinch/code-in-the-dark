--- The rules ---
1) No previews - of either results or assets!
2) Stay in this editor at all times
3) No measurement tools
4) Stop coding when the time's up
5) After the round is over, press "Finish" and follow the prompt instructions to see your results

Good luck and most important of all; have fun!

--- Assets ---
./twitter-bg.png (5032x4090)
./twitter-icon-sm.png (45x45)


--- Hints ---
Oops, someone dropped this: #1da1f2

twitter-bg.png is just a giant version of the Twitter logo. It's up to you to guess how to set up the background
property so that it blows up outside of the container.
