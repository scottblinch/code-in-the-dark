--- The rules ---
1) No previews - of either results or assets!
2) Stay in this editor at all times
3) No measurement tools
4) Stop coding when the time's up
5) After the round is over, press "Finish" and follow the prompt instructions to see your results

Good luck and most important of all; have fun!

--- Hints ---

1. Colors used are just basic red, black, and white. No need to get fancy.
2. border-radius: 50%; makes things nice and circular.
3. Pokeballs keep their pokemans nice and contained, almost as if they hide their overflow.
